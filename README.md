<h1>ImageZoom</h1>
the idea of this project is to go into the picture(div#1) details in a little box(div#2)and it will show you the zoomed part in a seperate box under the picture(div#3)</br></br>
Doing math is a big part of this project
<h2>Strategy</h2>
at first I had to find the connection between the width of my .lens div to the width of .result div and divided them and put into a variable which will be uesd later(Cx & Cy).
then I had to use JS to find the location of my mouse(offsetLeft and offsetTop) and move the div with it.
<h3>Strategy P2</h3>
After calculating Cx and Cy in the result function and multiplies it to (offsetLeft and offsetTop),We can set the backgound of the result.
<h4>Note</h4>
you can go to the code and in HTML,upload your own photo and zoom in your picture.
Enjoy :)
